# Purpose
This project is created for the recruitment process of KUDOSTA SOLUTIONS LLP for the position of React Native Developer.

## About Project
It's a shift management  app where in we can fetch the list of available shifts using the API provided and then book and cancel the shifts accordingly. 
The app displays the overlapping shifts considering the already booked shifts.
Also the option to book the shifts which are already started is disabled.

## How to run the Project.
As we are fetching the data from backend APIs, we need to provide the server url in util/apiHelpers.
You may follow the react native documentation to run the project or build the apk.
Make sure the server side code is running when you test the app!! :)
